	<span class="testimonial-text">Dr. Milan is a true artist! With porcelain veneers, he transformed my teeth and my smile from dark and crooked to straight and white. I have 100 percent trust and confidence in his abilities and integrity.  His friendly team and comfortable environment made it an exceptional experience. This was truly one of the best investments I have ever made. The only mistake is that I waited about 15 years too long! Being a surgeon myself, I looked hard and long to find the right person and luckily found Dr. Milan. <a href="<?php get_site_url();?>/testimonials">READ MORE testimonials</a></span>
